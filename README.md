## **Abstract**.
The objective of this research is to study the effectiveness of a specialized artificial intelligence (AI) system designed exclusively for learning programming. The hypothesis of the study is that a domain-focused AI assistant, concentrated on a single subject area, can provide deeper explanations, more accurate error analysis, and more effective learning support compared to general-purpose AI systems.
The research was conducted in several stages: analysis of existing approaches to programming education, design and independent development of a specialized AI assistant, practical testing of the system, and evaluation of learning outcomes. The methodology included comparative task solving, analysis of programming errors, measurement of time efficiency, and observation of user progress.
The novelty of this research lies in the creation of a narrowly focused AI system that possesses deeper contextual understanding of programming concepts within its specific domain. Unlike general AI tools, the developed system is optimized for explaining programming logic, debugging, and guiding beginners step by step. The project was completed independently by the authors without external mentorship.
The results demonstrate that the specialized AI improves conceptual understanding, reduces repeated errors, and increases learning efficiency. The practical significance of this work is the potential implementation of domain-specific AI assistants in school programming education and self-study environments.                                                        

                                                                                                                                         Introduction. In recent years, programming has become one of the most important skills in modern education and professional development. It is widely applied in science, engineering, business, and everyday technologies. However, many students experience significant difficulties when learning programming due to abstract concepts, strict syntax rules, and the need for structured logical thinking. Beginners often struggle with debugging, understanding program flow, and independently identifying errors, which can reduce motivation and slow down the learning process.
At the same time, artificial intelligence technologies are rapidly developing and increasingly being integrated into educational environments. Most existing AI systems are general-purpose tools designed to operate across multiple subject areas. While such systems provide broad access to information, they are not always optimized for deep conceptual support within a specific academic discipline. Programming education, in particular, requires precise explanations, structured reasoning, and accurate analysis of code errors.
A domain-specialized AI system focused exclusively on programming may provide deeper contextual understanding and more relevant feedback compared to general-purpose AI tools. By concentrating on a single subject area, such a system can prioritize programming logic, common beginner mistakes, and step-by-step explanation strategies. This creates the potential for more effective individualized learning support.
The relevance of this research lies in the growing need for efficient and accessible tools that can assist students in mastering programming skills. As programming becomes a fundamental component of modern education, innovative approaches are required to improve comprehension and reduce learning barriers.
The objective of this work is to develop and study a domain-specialized AI-based assistant designed exclusively for programming education. To achieve this objective, the following tasks were set: to analyze existing approaches to teaching programming and AI-based tutoring systems; to independently design and implement a specialized AI assistant; and to evaluate its effectiveness through practical testing.
The methods used to solve these tasks include analytical review of scientific literature, independent software development, experimental task-based evaluation, comparative analysis of learning results, and interpretation of obtained data.

1. Analytical Review of Existing Results.
Research on programming education shows that beginner students frequently struggle with syntax errors, algorithmic thinking, and understanding program flow [1], [2]. One of the key challenges identified in multiple studies is the lack of immediate and individualized feedback, which often leads to repeated mistakes and decreased motivation [1].
Traditional educational approaches, such as classroom lectures and textbooks, are limited in their ability to adapt to individual learning pace and style. As noted by Bennedsen and Caspersen, high failure rates in introductory programming courses are partially caused by insufficient personalized support [2]. Digital learning platforms attempt to address this issue through automated testing and predefined hints; however, these systems usually provide fixed responses and lack contextual understanding [3].
Most modern AI systems used in education are general-purpose tools designed to operate across multiple disciplines. Although such systems provide wide-ranging knowledge, they may lack optimization for deep contextual understanding within a specific academic field. Programming education requires structured logical explanations, accurate debugging analysis, and step-by-step reasoning support.
Research on intelligent tutoring systems suggests that domain-specific educational systems often provide more targeted feedback and structured assistance within their field of specialization [3], [4]. This supports the hypothesis that a narrowly focused AI assistant, concentrated exclusively on programming, may offer deeper conceptual understanding and more effective educational support compared to general-purpose AI tools.
2. Description of the Developed AI System
The design of the developed AI system is based on principles commonly described in intelligent tutoring research. Studies emphasize that effective educational AI systems should focus on explanation quality, adaptability, and learner engagement rather than simply providing correct answers [3], [4].
Similar to approaches described in recent AI-assisted programming studies, the system analyzes user-submitted code and provides feedback explaining the cause of errors and possible solutions [6], [8]. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, AI-driven assistants can adjust explanations depending on the user’s question and level of understanding, which has been shown to improve learning outcomes [6]..
3. Methods for Solving the Research Tasks
The experimental methodology used in this research follows approaches described in studies evaluating AI-assisted learning systems [6], [8]. Programming tasks of comparable difficulty were selected to ensure objective comparison of results. Evaluation criteria such as solution correctness, error frequency, and time efficiency are commonly used in educational technology research and allow for reliable assessment of learning effectiveness [5], [6].
4. Results and Discussion
Figure 1: Pedagogical benefits
The results obtained in this study are consistent with findings reported in recent research on AI in programming education. Multiple studies indicate that personalized feedback is one of the most significant advantages of AI-based learning systems [6], [7]. As shown in Figure 1, personalized feedback (44.83%) was identified as the most impactful factor, supporting conclusions made by Tang et al. Regarding scalable AI feedback in programming classrooms [7].
Learning gains and improved time efficiency observed in this research are also supported by previous studies, which report that AI assistants help reduce debugging time and improve conceptual understanding [6], [8]. However, researchers also emphasize that AI should be used as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for traditional instruction [4], [5], which aligns with the conclusions of this work.
Conclusion. The findings of this research confirm conclusions made in previous studies that artificial intelligence can significantly support programming education by providing adaptive feedback and reducing learning difficulties [4], [6]. The independently developed AI system demonstrates practical value and aligns with current trends in educational technology development [5].
