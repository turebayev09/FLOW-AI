## **Abstract**.
The objective of this research is to study the effectiveness of using artificial intelligence (AI) as a tool for learning programming and improving student's understanding of programming concepts. The hypothesis of the study is that an independently developed AI system can help learners better understand programming logic, identify errors, and improve problem-solving skills compared to traditional learning methods.
The research was conducted in several stages: analysis of existing approaches to learning programming, independent development of an AI-based assistant, testing its functionality in practice, and evaluation of learning outcomes. The research methodology included analysis of solved programming tasks, comparison of results before and after using the AI, and observation of user's progress during the learning process.
The novelty of the research lies in the fact that the AI system was fully developed by the authors themselves. The degree of independence is high, as all stages—from idea development to implementation and testing—were completed by the students. The results demonstrate that the AI helps users understand programming concepts more effectively and reduces the time needed to solve tasks.
The practical significance of this work is the possibility of using the developed AI as an educational tool for learning programming in schools and for self-study.                                                        

                                                                                                                                         Introduction. In recent years, programming has become one of the most important skills in modern education. It is widely used in science, engineering, economics, and everyday technologies. However, many students face difficulties when learning programming due to the complexity of abstract concepts, strict syntax rules, and the need for logical thinking. Traditional teaching methods often do not provide sufficient individual support, which can lead to a loss of motivation and slow learning progress.
At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are rapidly developing and are increasingly being applied in the field of education. AI systems are capable of analyzing user actions, providing instant feedback, explaining errors, and adapting learning materials to the learner’s level. This creates new opportunities for personalized learning, especially in such a challenging subject as programming.
The relevance of this research lies in the need to find effective and accessible ways to help students learn programming more efficiently. The use of AI as a learning assistant may help overcome common difficulties, such as misunderstanding programming logic, debugging errors, and lack of immediate support.
The objective of this work is to develop and study an AI-based system that assists users in learning programming. To achieve this objective, the following tasks were set: to analyze existing methods of learning programming, to independently develop an AI assistant for educational purposes, and to evaluate its effectiveness in practice.
The main methods used to solve these tasks include analytical review of existing educational approaches, independent software development, testing of the AI system, and analysis of learning results obtained during its use.

1. Analytical Review of Existing Results
Research on programming education shows that beginner students frequently struggle with syntax errors, algorithmic thinking, and understanding program flow [1], [2]. One of the key challenges identified in multiple studies is the lack of immediate and individualized feedback, which often leads to repeated mistakes and decreased motivation [1].
Traditional educational approaches, such as classroom lectures and textbooks, are limited in their ability to adapt to individual learning pace and style. As noted by Bennedsen and Caspersen, high failure rates in introductory programming courses are partially caused by insufficient personalized support [2]. Digital learning platforms attempt to address this issue through automated testing and predefined hints; however, these systems usually provide fixed responses and lack contextual understanding [3].
Recent studies highlight the potential of artificial intelligence–based systems to overcome these limitations. AI-powered tutors are capable of analyzing student input dynamically and generating adaptive explanations tailored to the learner’s current level [3], [4]. According to Woolf, intelligent tutoring systems can significantly enhance conceptual understanding by focusing on explanation rather than direct correction [3]. This confirms the relevance of using AI as an educational assistant in programming education.
2. Description of the Developed AI System
The design of the developed AI system is based on principles commonly described in intelligent tutoring research. Studies emphasize that effective educational AI systems should focus on explanation quality, adaptability, and learner engagement rather than simply providing correct answers [3], [4].
Similar to approaches described in recent AI-assisted programming studies, the system analyzes user-submitted code and provides feedback explaining the cause of errors and possible solutions [6], [8]. Unlike traditional rule-based systems, AI-driven assistants can adjust explanations depending on the user’s question and level of understanding, which has been shown to improve learning outcomes [6]..
3. Methods for Solving the Research Tasks
The experimental methodology used in this research follows approaches described in studies evaluating AI-assisted learning systems [6], [8]. Programming tasks of comparable difficulty were selected to ensure objective comparison of results. Evaluation criteria such as solution correctness, error frequency, and time efficiency are commonly used in educational technology research and allow for reliable assessment of learning effectiveness [5], [6].
4. Results and Discussion
Figure 1: Pedagogical benefits
The results obtained in this study are consistent with findings reported in recent research on AI in programming education. Multiple studies indicate that personalized feedback is one of the most significant advantages of AI-based learning systems [6], [7]. As shown in Figure 1, personalized feedback (44.83%) was identified as the most impactful factor, supporting conclusions made by Tang et al. Regarding scalable AI feedback in programming classrooms [7].
Learning gains and improved time efficiency observed in this research are also supported by previous studies, which report that AI assistants help reduce debugging time and improve conceptual understanding [6], [8]. However, researchers also emphasize that AI should be used as a complementary tool rather than a replacement for traditional instruction [4], [5], which aligns with the conclusions of this work.
Conclusion. The findings of this research confirm conclusions made in previous studies that artificial intelligence can significantly support programming education by providing adaptive feedback and reducing learning difficulties [4], [6]. The independently developed AI system demonstrates practical value and aligns with current trends in educational technology development [5].
